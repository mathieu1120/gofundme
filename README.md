Here's a CSV of our favorite restaurants. You'll need to import this into a MySQL database or read from this file directly in PHP for the next step.

Using the information above code us a page that:
-Has a place for a user to type
-As the user is typing, a list of restaurant names should be shown to them. The results should include any restaurant whose name starts with the letters the user has typed so far AND any restaurant whose cuisine starts with the letters typed so far.
-This page needs to be fast, look good and function properly.
-This needs to be coded in PHP and jQuery
